Why use a static keyword on functions

Data members may be declared outside the main method
this data members will not be used in the main method, unless we declare them with the keyword static

example:
static int varName;

or 
static void myFunction()
{
    //bluh bluh body
}

Since both this myFunction and varName are having keyword static, they can now be used in the main method or anywhere
