There is a class called File that can create a new file
It has a contructor File("name.txt") that creates a new file
"name.txt" becomes the name of the txt document
File class is imported in java.io.File;

Well, in order to write any file, of course, you use a writer()
writer is a method inside a class FileWriter
FileWriter class is imported in java.io.FileWriter;
writer() accepts arguments which are type byte[]

1 byte = 8 bits
Do you know that each character is 8 bits?
so meaning 
    byte myVar = 'A';
and also 
    byte[] = {'B', 'o', 'o', 'K', ' ', '1'};

So let us go back to writer(byte[] o), dont forget that o is type byte[]


/*
Relative path is the name of the file
e.g  src\myClass.java

Path is the overall path that points the location where a file is stored
C:\Users\Cleme\Desktop\programming java\Java projects\Data Structures\Assignments\Assignment 1\Assignment 2\src\myClass.java
